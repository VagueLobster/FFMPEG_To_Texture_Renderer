# FFMPEG_To_Texture_Renderer
My Video Renderer used in my Hazel2D Clone...

It is recommended to use this with the code from Hazel2D for easy operation,
which can be obtained by going to https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/
Though, you can use this code however you see fit.

You will also need FFMpeg's .dll files, and how to get them is up to you,
but, I can recommend this small Youtuber called Dev Stef and this video of his:
